Hi !! 
I'm the *PolimiBot* and I can help you to easily find a classroom for studying.
(Or whatever you want to do in a Polimi Classroom).

I'm in the first official release, so I support only Leonardo classrooms.

*Here there is the list of my commands:*
1. /occupation `[dd-mm-yyyy]` 
    I will give you a HTML file concerning the occupation status of all polimi Leonardo classrooms in the selected day.
    If you don't give me anything I will give you the occupation status of today.
2. /free `hh:mm hh:mm [dd-mm-yyyy]` 
    I will send you the list of the free classrooms from the first time passed to the second one, in the given day.
    If you don't give me the date I will return the list of today.
3. /classroom className `[dd-mm-yyyy]` 
    I will send you the photo of occupation status of the given classroom in the selected day.
    If you don't give me the date I will return the occupation status of today.
4. /help 
    I will send you the commands list.

All the content enclosed by `[]` is optional.

I Hope I will be Useful !!
