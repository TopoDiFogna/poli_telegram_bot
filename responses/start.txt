Hi !! I'm the **PolimiBot** and I can help you to easily find a classroom for studying.
(or whatever you want to do in a Polimi Classroom)

I'm in the first official release, so I support only Leonardo classrooms.

*Here there is the lists of my commands:*
1. /occupation [dd-mm-yyy] I will give you a HTML file concerning the occupation status of all polimi Leonardo classrooms of the selected day.
						   If you don't pass me anything I will give you the today occupation status.
2. /free hh:mm hh:mm [dd-mm-yyyy] I will send you the list of free classrooms from the first time passed to the second one, in the given day.
								  If you don't pass me the date I will give the today list.
3. /classroom className [dd-mm-yyyy] I will send you the photo of the given classroom occupation status in the selected day.
									 If you don't pass me the date I will give the today occupation status.
									 The class name must respect the Polimi standard ex: N.0.2, L26.1.3,D.2.1
4. /help I will send you the commands list.
All the content enclosed by [] is optional.

I Hope I will be Useful !!
