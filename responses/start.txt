Hi !! I'm the *PolimiBot* and I can help you to easily find a classroom for studying.
(or whatever you want to do in a Polimi Classroom)

I'm in the first official release, so I support only Leonardo classrooms.

*Here there is the lists of my commands:*
+ /occupation `[dd-mm-yyy]` 
	I will give you a HTML file concerning the occupation status of all polimi Leonardo classrooms of the selected day.
	If you don't pass me anything I will give you the today occupation status.
	(Don't worry about the strange name of the file, it's safe ;) )
+ /free hh:mm hh:mm `[dd-mm-yyyy]` 
	I will send you the list of free classrooms from the first time passed to the second one, in the given day.
	If you don't pass me the date I will give the today list.
+ /classroom className `[dd-mm-yyyy]` 
	I will send you the photo of the given classroom occupation status in the selected day.
	If you don't pass me the date I will give the today occupation status.
	The class name must respect the Polimi standard ex: N.0.2, L26.1.3,D.2.1
4. /help 
	I will send you the commands list.
All the content enclosed by `[]` is optional.

I Hope I will be Useful !!
